<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Aser Atawya</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Computer Science Senior at Pomona College in Claremont, California (graduating December 2024)</h3>

- I’m currently looking for full-time software engineering internships in the fall (September - December) and full-time positions with start date in early 2025.
- This Summer, I will be doing tiny Machine Learning research at Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems Lab at Pomona College, working on quantizing deep neural networks and deploying them on edge devices!
- Last semester, I co-developed a 5000+ Lines-of-Code, 21-class music sharing web app that creates real-time, collaborative music sessions using Spotify web API. Check out the [project repo!](https://github.com//jacobymon/M-3/)
- Last year, I designed a complete convolutional neural network data pipeline to simulate human driving in a virtual environment with the help of Udacity self-driving car simulator. Check out the [project repo!](https://github.com/Aser-Abdelfatah/Neural-Networks-for-Self-Driving-Cars)
- Also, I did Google Summer of Code 2023 for OpenCV, where I merged 3 pull requests, adding Recurrent All-pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) DNN optical flow model to OpenCV model zoo. Also, I optimized visualization module and provided scripts for evaluation and examples in C++ and Python. Check out the [project summary!](https://github.com/Aser-Abdelfatah/Google_Summer_of_Code_2023_OpenCV_Optical_Flow_Summary)
